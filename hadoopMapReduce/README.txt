This MapReduce Java program will use map reduce to determine the number of tweets during each hour of the day.

Note: the tweet data file was >5 GB so it is not included in the repo.

This is the format of a tweet in the tweet data: (T = tweet data/time, U = user url, W = tweet content)

T	2009-06-12 02:49:39
U	http://twitter.com/dcgrrl
W	thank goodness tomorrow's Friday. I'm done!
