This MapReduce Java program will use map reduce to determine the number of tweets during each hour of the day.

Note: the tweet data file was >5 GB so it is not included in the repo.

This is the format of a tweet in the tweet data: (T = tweet data/time, U = user url, W = tweet content)

T	<tweet data/time YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>
U	http://twitter.com/<username>
W	<tweet content>
